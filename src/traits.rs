/// implemented by hand: use `#[derive(IntoHeap)]` instead. All primitive types
/// and many standard types support `IntoHeap`.
///
/// That is all you need to know in order to use cell-gc. The rest is really
/// implementation detail.
///
/// Implementation note: every type with `'static` lifetime should be safe to
/// store in the heap, because ref types are never `'static`. Unfortunately
/// rustc cannot be made to understand this. It would be *legal* to write this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// unsafe impl<'h, T: Clone + 'static> IntoHeap<'h> for T { ...trivial... }
/// ```
///
/// but alas, Rust thinks this impl conflicts with almost all others, making it
/// impossible to get the macro to work. So instead we `impl IntoHeap for` a
/// lot of individual types by hand.
///
/// **Liveness.** Some `IntoHeap` types ("Ref" types) are effectively smart
/// pointers to in-heap values. To preserve safety, if an `IntoHeap` value is
/// (or contains) a smart pointer to an in-heap value, then that value (and
/// everything reachable from it) is protected from GC.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Implementing `IntoHeap<'h>` tells cell-gc that a type integrates with
/// garbage collection. All the methods in the type's `IntoHeapBase` impl must
/// be correct or it will explode.
///
/// *   In-heap values are typically full of pointers; if `into_heap` puts
///     garbage into them, GC will crash.
///
/// *   `trace` must be implemented with care in order to preserve the
///     invariants of the GC graph-walking algorithm. Bugs there are very
///     likely to lead to dangling pointers and hard-to-debug crashes down the
///     road.
///
/// *   `GcHeap` implements `Send`. This means any value that can be stored in
///     the heap can be sent to other threads (by sending the whole heap). So
///     don't implement this trait for any type that isn't itself already
///     `Send`. (The reason this trait doesn't *require* `Send` is that at
///     present, `Ref` types must *not* be `Send` but must implement
///     `IntoHeap`.)  It's OK to store non-`Sync` values in the heap.
///
/// *   And this probably goes without saying, but none of these methods may
///     allocate or do anything else that could trigger garbage collection.
