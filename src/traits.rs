/// Trait for values that can be moved into a GC heap.
///
/// Cell-gc does not support GC allocation of arbitrary values: only values of
/// types that implement `IntoHeap`. This trait is **not** meant to be
/// implemented by hand: use the `gc_heap_type!` macro instead. All primitive
/// types and many standard types support `IntoHeap`.
///
/// GC types come in pairs: an *in-heap* type, which is stored physically inside
/// the heap, and may be packed with pointer fields and unsafe methods; and an
/// `IntoHeap` type, which is safe, is used in application code, and lives on
/// the stack. Both types have the same layout, bit for bit.
///
/// (The word "safe" above means that, as with everything generally in Rust, you
/// can hack without fear. `IntoHeap` types don't expose raw Rust pointers or
/// references to GC memory, they don't expose the unsafe in-heap types, and
/// they obey Rust's safety and aliasing rules.)
///
/// Users never get a direct `&` reference to any in-heap value. All access is
/// through safe `IntoHeap` types, like the `Ref` type that is automatically
/// declared for you when you use `gc_heap_type!` to declare a struct.
///
/// *   For primitive types, like `i32`, the two types are the same.
///
/// *   Macro-generated "Ref" types are `IntoHeap` types; the corresponding
///     in-heap types are effectively raw pointers.
///
/// *   For macro-generated structs and enums, the user specifies the names of
///     both types. Both types have identical fields or variants, but fields of
///     the in-heap type are in-heap, and fields of the `IntoHeap` type are
///     `IntoHeap`.
///
/// Implementation note: every type with `'static` lifetime should be safe to
/// store in the heap, because ref types are never `'static`. Unfortunately I
/// can't make rustc understand this. It would be *legal* to write this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// unsafe impl<'h, T: Clone + 'static> IntoHeap<'h> for T { ...trivial... }
/// ```
///
/// but alas, Rust thinks this impl conflicts with almost all others, making it
/// impossible to get the macro to work. So instead we `impl IntoHeap for` a
/// lot of individual types by hand.
///
/// **Liveness.** Some `IntoHeap` types ("Ref" types) are effectively smart
/// pointers to in-heap values. To preserve safety, if an `IntoHeap` value is
/// (or contains) a smart pointer to an in-heap value, then that value (and
/// everything reachable from it) is protected from GC.
///
/// Unsafe to implement: in-heap objects are full of pointers; if `into_heap`
/// puts garbage into them, GC will crash. `mark` must be implmented with care
/// in order to preserve the invariants of the GC graph-walking algorithm.
/// Bugs there are very likely to lead to dangling pointers and
/// hard-to-debug crashes down the road.
